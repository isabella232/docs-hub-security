# Developer's Guide

The Security Layer relies on FIWARE components that are all Open Source, fully documented with an existing community managing them. Itâ€™s always possible (as in any open source project) to propose evolution and corrections.

* AuthZForce : [https://github.com/authzforce/core](https://github.com/authzforce/core)

## Potential extensions
The current version of KeyRock uses a MySQL Database to manage the objects. An evolution could be to propose a different driver database to allow KeyRock to work with an external IdM solution like LDAP to be more closely integrated in the port IT solution.


## Additional notes
FIWARE propose documentation to easily integrate their solutions:
